### Read this before any snippet: use the public mirror, not the address in `tree-sitter.json`

`tree-sitter.json` records `https://git.daveynet.xyz/davey/redextape`, which is where this project
actually lives — and **no editor can fetch it.** Re-measured 2026-08-27, unchanged from when this
section was first written on 2026-08-21:

```
$ curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' \
    'https://forge.daveynet.xyz/davey/redextape/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack'
401

$ curl -sS 'https://git.daveynet.xyz/davey/redextape/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack' | wc -c
0
```

`forge.daveynet.xyz` is the HTTP git host and refuses anonymous access outright, which is the honest
failure. `git.daveynet.xyz` is the **SSH** clone host; over HTTPS it answers the ref advertisement with
**HTTP 200 and a zero-byte body**, which git reads as *a repository with no refs* — `git ls-remote` exits
`0` and prints nothing. **That is a silent empty, not an error**, and an editor pointed at the HTTPS
`git.` URL reports something unhelpful rather than "you are not authorized".

**So every snippet below names the public GitHub mirror instead**, which needs no credentials at all:

```
$ curl -sS -L -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' \
    https://github.com/Davey-Hughes/redextape/archive/main.tar.gz
200
```

**The mirror is a mirror, and `tree-sitter.json` is not wrong to keep pointing past it.** Pull
requests, CI and the roadmap live on the Forgejo instance; GitHub carries a copy of the refs so that
an editor has something to fetch. If you have a key on the instance,
`ssh://git@git.daveynet.xyz/davey/redextape.git` is the same tree and works too.
