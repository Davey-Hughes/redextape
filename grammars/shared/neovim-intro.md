### Neovim — nvim-treesitter

**If you use lazy.nvim, the whole configuration is one line.** This repository ships its own
`plugin/redextape.lua`, and lazy sources `plugin/**/*.lua` from a plugin's root directory when it
loads that plugin:

```lua
{ "Davey-Hughes/redextape", lazy = false }
```

That registers all four grammars, claims the four extensions, **and starts the highlighter** — which
is a separate thing that nothing else does. Neovim auto-starts treesitter only for its own bundled
filetypes, and nvim-treesitter ships no `FileType` autocmd, so a parser can be installed and a
filetype set and the buffer still open with no colour at all.

`.rxt` and `.rxlambda` are claimed by extension. `.asm` and `.tm` are claimed by **sniffing the
buffer**, because Neovim already maps them to `asm` and `tcl`: a listing that is not this project's
keeps the filetype it had. `lazy = false` is required — filetype registration has to happen at
startup, and a lazy-loaded spec would not register this project's extensions until something had
already loaded it. Then, once:

```vim
:TSInstall redextape redextape_asm redextape_lambda redextape_tm
```

**That one line requires nvim-treesitter's `main` branch**, and the next paragraph explains why that
is a real fork in the road rather than a version number. `plugin/redextape.lua` uses `main`'s
registration API and `main`'s `User TSUpdate` event, neither of which exists on `master`; on `master`
the autocmd never fires, no parser is registered, and the filetype mappings still apply — leaving the
four extensions claimed with nothing to parse them. **If you are on `master`, skip the one-liner and
use the hand-written block below.**

**Everything below is for everyone else** — `master`, a different plugin manager, or nvim-treesitter
driven by hand. It is close to what `plugin/redextape.lua` does, with two deliberate differences
worth knowing before you copy it: the blocks below claim `.asm` and `.tm` **unconditionally by
extension**, which is simpler and takes every such file on your machine away from `asm` and `tcl`,
and they do not start the highlighter. If you want colour you need a `FileType` autocmd calling
`vim.treesitter.start()` as well — see the end of this section.

**nvim-treesitter's `main` branch does not clone.** Its installer strips a trailing `.git` from
`url`, builds `<url>/archive/<revision>.tar.gz`, and fetches that with `curl`, then expects the
archive to expand to a directory named `<repo>-<revision>`. GitHub's archive endpoint matches that
shape exactly — including stripping a leading `v` from a tag — which is why the snippets below work.
It also means each of the four grammars downloads the whole repository separately.

nvim-treesitter has **two live branches that are incompatible plugins sharing a name.** `main` is the
current rewrite and needs Neovim 0.12+; `master` is frozen and works with Neovim ≤ 0.11. Pick the one you
have installed — the `install_info` field sets are different, and fields from one are silently ignored by
the other.
