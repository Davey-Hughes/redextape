# Land a feature branch on main as ONE commit that passes the gate on its own.
#
#   scripts/land.sh                      # land the current branch (opens an editor for the subject)
#   scripts/land.sh my-branch            # land a named branch
#   scripts/land.sh -- --flag            # pass --flag through to scripts/check-all.sh
#   scripts/land.sh -m "feat(tm): ..."   # skip the editor, use this subject
#   scripts/land.sh --no-gate            # land without running the gate (loud, discouraged)
#   scripts/land.sh --keep-branch        # do not delete the branch after landing
#
# WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT `git merge --squash`:
#
#   1. The gate runs on the MERGED tree, BEFORE the commit exists. Every commit on main is meant to
#      be an atomic unit that builds and passes CI by itself; the only way to know that is to check
#      the merged result and refuse to commit when it fails. `git merge --squash && git commit` gets
#      this backwards — it creates the commit first and finds out afterwards.
#
#   2. `git merge --squash` DISCARDS every commit message on the branch. The message here is
#      prefilled with all of them, so the reasoning survives the squash instead of being traded for
#      a tidy graph. Delete what you do not want; what is left is kept verbatim.
#
# The remote enforces the same shape from the other direction: allow_merge_commits is off and
# default_merge_style is squash, so a PR merged in the web UI cannot produce a merge commit either.
# CI's `linear-history` job remains the actual gate — this is convenience, like setup-dev.sh.
